<h1>Thanks</h1>
<p>Several sharp-eyed readers of this tutorial have noticed bugs, and
in some cases supplied patches.  Thanks!</p>
<table>
  <tr><td>Neeraj Rawat</td><td>The code wasn't portable to FreeBSD.
    It's thanks to Neeraj that I switched to GNU autotools, and made
    several changes for compatibility with FreeBSD</td></tr>
  <tr><td>David&nbsp;Terret:</td><td><code>bb_readlink()</code> was returning number of
    bytes read instead of 0</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Patrick&nbsp;Ulam:</td><td>bb_release() wasn't closing the
    file</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Patrick&nbsp;Ulam and Bernardo&nbsp;F&nbsp;Costa:</td><td><code>bb_readlink()</code>
    wasn't null-terminating the string.  Patrick and Bernardo also
    supplied patches!  The current <code><code>bb_readlink()</code></code> code is
    Bernardo's</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bernardo&nbsp;F&nbsp;Costa:</td><td>Command-line argument parsing
      wasn't handling <code>-o</code> correctly</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bernardo&nbsp;F&nbsp;Costa:</td><td>Got me thinking about security implications</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Diogo&nbsp;Melo and Sivan&nbsp;Tal:</td><td>Makefile order
    of arguments was wrong and caused link errors for some (but not
      all!) users</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Skippy&nbsp;VonDrake</td><td>Pointed out the code I used to
	use for command line parsing was confusing, so I wound up
	rewriting it</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Ivan Middleton</td><td>Discovered my xattr code wasn't
	  ever being compiled, and had a bug besides</td></tr>
