<title>Writing a FUSE Filesystem: a Tutorial</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Organization</h1>
<p>
The tutorial is divided into the following sections:
</p>

<dl>
    <p>
  <dt><a href="files.html" >Files and Naming Conventions in This Tutorial</a>
  <dd>This section describes the files distributed as a part of this
    tutorial, and the naming conventions for the functions in the
    <code>BBFS</code> filesystem.  It's really there to provide an
    overview of the whole tutorial and filesystem, not to directly
    provide information on FUSE.
    </p>
    
    <p>
  <dt><a href="running.html" >Running BBFS</a>
  <dd>A little bit of information on mounting a filesystem
  with <code>bbfs</code>, watching the log, and unmounting it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
  <dt><a href="callbacks.html" >Callbacks and <code>struct&nbsp;fuse_operations</code></a>
  <dd>This is the heart of a FUSE filesystem, and of this tutorial.
  The central concepts are discussed here.
</p>
    
    <p>
  <dt><a href="init.html" >Parsing the Command Line and Initializing FUSE</a>
  <dd>Getting your program started.
    </p>
    
    <p>
  <dt><a href="private.html" >Private Data and Related Topics</a>
  <dd>Maintaining filesystem state.
    </p>
    
    <p>
  <dt><a href="unclear.html" >Extra Information on Unclear FUSE Functions</a>
  <dd>The intent of this section is to give some extra information on
  FUSE functions that seem a little unclear.  Write now, this section
  covers <code>readdir()</code> and FUSE's handling of the file
  creation flags to <code>open()</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
  <dt><a href="security.html" >Security Considerations and Race Conditions</a>
  <dd>Running a FUSE filesystem may raise some security issues that
  you should be aware of.  Also, since the FUSE server is multithreaded,
  there may be some race conditions you need to think about.
    </p>
    
    <p>
  <dt><a href="thanks.html" >Thanks and Other Resources</a>
  <dd>I'd like to acknowledge people who've helped by noticing bugs
  (or in any other way).  Also, this is not the only resource on FUSE
  on the web.
    </p>
