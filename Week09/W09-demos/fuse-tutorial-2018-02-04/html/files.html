<h1>Files and Naming Conventions</h1>
<p>Before we get into the details of using FUSE, and of the Big
  Brother File System, let's see how the files are organized.
</p>
<p>The code for the BBFS running example is in subdirectory <code>../src</code></p>

<dl><p>
  <dt><a href="../src/Makefile" ><code>Makefile</code></a>
  <dd>As usual, a <code>Makefile</code> is used to direct the
  compilation of the code.  The code is so simple that I just
  hard-coded a Makefile rather than using automake; it requires
  <code>pkg-config</code> (and of course FUSE!), but everything else
  ought to be available in any Linux system used for development.
    </p>
    <p>
  <dt><a href="../src/bbfs.c" ><code>bbfs.c</code></a>
  <dd>The code re-implementing the Linux file operations is in
    this file.  Every function defined in this file starts with
    <code>bb_</code>, so it's easy to tell my code from system
    code.
    </p>
    <p>
    The file also contains a
  <code>struct&nbsp;fuse_operations&nbsp;</code> named
  <code>bb_oper</code>, containing pointers to the functions (we'll
  discuss this <code>struct</code> in the next section)
    </p>
    <p>
    The functions that are pointed to by fields in the
    <code>struct&nbsp;fuse</code> data structure all have names
    derived from their field names by prepending the standard
    <code>bb_</code> prefix.  So, for instance, the
    <code>open()</code> function is <code>bb_open()</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
  <dt><a href="../src/log.c" ><code>log.c</code></a> and <a href="../src/log.h" ><code>log.h</code></a>
  <dd>The logging code, reporting all the operations that are
    performed, is in <code>log.c</code>.  Their names all start with
    <code>log_</code>, again to help identify the logging code.
    <code>log.h</code> contains prototypes for the functions that
    are called from elsewhere (and, of course, the only "elsewhere"
    in this project is <code>bbfs.c</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
  <dt><a href="../src/params.h" ><code>params.h</code></a>
  <dd>This defines which version of the FUSE API is being used,
    defines a symbol that give me access to the <code>pread()</code>
    system call, and defines a <code>struct&nbsp;bb_state</code>
    that stores filesystem state.
    </p>
</dl>

<p>
I should also mention that nearly all of the documentation on FUSE
itself is in the <code>#include</code> file
<code>/usr/include/fuse/fuse.h</code>.  This is where prototypes are
given for all functions, and comments describe their use.  My
<code>bbfs.c</code> file started as a copy of that file, with my code
inserted.
